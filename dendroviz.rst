How to Visualize Dendrograms
============================

DendroStar (Java Applet)
------------------------

DendroStar is a demo that shows the connection between dendrograms and
the images they describe. You can visit it `here
<http://am.iic.harvard.edu/index.cgi/DendroStar/applet>`_. However, it
cannot be applied to other datasets.

DendroViz (IDL library)
-----------------------

DendroViz is an IDL package designed to visualize dendrograms
interactively. Documentation is forthcoming, but for now see these
links:
